      This project is a fun initiative aimed at gathering opinions on the best players and analyzing
      draft statistics for the Deadman Allstars event. Rest assured, no personal data is collected,
      no advertisements are displayed, and all images are credited to their respective creators.
      This project will be removed once the draft concludes.
