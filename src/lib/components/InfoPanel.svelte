    <p>
      The Deadman Mode Allstars draft has over 620 quintillion possible combinations 
      (24! or 620,448,401,733,239,439,360,000). This platform tracks predictions to 
      see if anyone can accurately predict the entire draft order.

    <p>
      There's a <span class="font-bold text-gray-800">100M OSRS GP bounty</span> for the first 
      person to submit a completely correct draft board. This is a small amount but is all i've got as a poor GIM.

      concludes. If no perfect bracket exists, the most accurate prediction (determined by a 
      fitness algorithm) will receive the prize.
